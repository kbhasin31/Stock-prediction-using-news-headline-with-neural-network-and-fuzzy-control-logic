# Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a stock prediction model that utilizes news headlines along with advanced techniques like Neural Network and Fuzzy Control Logic. The goal of the project is to predict stock price movements based on relevant news articles, enabling investors to make informed decisions.

# Project Overview
The project is divided into the following main components:

1. Data Collection: Gather financial data and news headlines related to the target stock from reliable sources.
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure compatibility with the model.
3. Sentiment Analysis: Perform sentiment analysis on news headlines to gauge their impact on stock sentiment.
4. Fuzzy Control Logic: Incorporate fuzzy control logic to handle uncertainties in stock predictions.
5. Neural Network Model: Implement a powerful neural network model for stock price forecasting.
6. Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using various metrics and visualize the results.

# Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using the following command:
# Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Usage
1. Run the data collection and preprocessing scripts to obtain and clean the data.
2. Execute the sentiment analysis module to calculate the sentiment scores of news headlines.
3. Implement the fuzzy control logic to handle fuzzy inference for stock predictions.
4. Train the neural network model on the preprocessed data.
5. Utilize the trained model to make stock price predictions.

# Results
The model achieves promising results in predicting stock price movements based on news headlines. The combination of Neural Network and Fuzzy Control Logic enhances the accuracy and robustness of the predictions. Detailed performance evaluation and visualizations can be found in the results directory.
